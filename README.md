# Scripts I have used during my Linux Years (2016 - Present day)

All these scripts are under the DO WHATEVER THE F*CK YOU WANT licence, so I don't really care what you do with them

You can however submit fixes/scripts and files there if you want to also contribute to this, I will try to check it as fast as I can.

Upstream repository is https://git.azhamspacestation.com/azhammakestrash/Linux-Scripts.
